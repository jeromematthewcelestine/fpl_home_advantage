```{r}
#| echo: false

```

## Data

We will use data from the [Fantasy Premier League data](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League) project, which I have downloaded separately. The data is stored season by season, so we first combine.

```{r}

```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
